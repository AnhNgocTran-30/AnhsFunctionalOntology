- Risk assessment: Risk = (threat x vulnerability (exploit likelihood x exploit impact) x asset value ) - security controls
- Treatment: 
+ remediation (apply a patch on a vulnerability where critical information are stored in order to fully/ nearly fully fix the vulnerability)
+ mitigation (implement a firewall rule that only allows specific systems to communicate with the vulnerable service on the server in stead of patching the vulnerability)
+ transference: purchase of insurance that will cover any losses that would be incurred if vulnerable systems are exploited to transfer the risk to another entity
+ risk acceptance: You have identified a vulnerability on a server but concluded that there is nothing sensitive on that server; it cannot be used as an entry point to access other critical assets, and a successful exploit of the vulnerability is very complex. Therefore, you accept the risk
+ You have identified servers with operating systems (OS) that are about to reach end-of-life and will no longer receive security patches from the OS creator. These servers process and store both sensitive and non-sensitive data. To avoid the risk of sensitive data being compromised, you quickly migrate that sensitive data to newer, patchable servers. The servers continue to run and process non-sensitive data while a plan is developed to decommission them and migrate non-sensitive data to other servers.

- Identification of risks: in terms of IT assets (online streaming platform is not compromised with music files), vulnalibility of system/ software, threats (natural disaster), controls (terminated users having access to a specific application)
- Risk assessment: Risk = (threat x vulnerability (exploit likelihood x exploit impact) x asset value ) - security controls
- Treatment: 
+ remediation (apply a patch on a vulnerability where critical information are stored in order to fully/ nearly fully fix the vulnerability)
+ mitigation (implement a firewall rule that only allows specific systems to communicate with the vulnerable service on the server in stead of patching the vulnerability)
+ transference: purchase of insurance that will cover any losses that would be incurred if vulnerable systems are exploited to transfer the risk to another entity
+ risk acceptance: You have identified a vulnerability on a server but concluded that there is nothing sensitive on that server; it cannot be used as an entry point to access other critical assets, and a successful exploit of the vulnerability is very complex. Therefore, you accept the risk
+ You have identified servers with operating systems (OS) that are about to reach end-of-life and will no longer receive security patches from the OS creator. These servers process and store both sensitive and non-sensitive data. To avoid the risk of sensitive data being compromised, you quickly migrate that sensitive data to newer, patchable servers. The servers continue to run and process non-sensitive data while a plan is developed to decommission them and migrate non-sensitive data to other servers.
- Communication: the decision for risk mitigation is communicated within the organization
- Rinse and repeat: continously monitor the mitigation plan""" ;
